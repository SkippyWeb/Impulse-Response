# Impulse Response



![](https://github.com/SkippyWeb/Images/blob/main/SkippyStudio.jpg)

 

This Python notebook aims to show the effect of room acoustics on a  single sine wave. The room acoustics is represented by an impulse response (IR) measured with Room EQ wizard (EQ).      

The IR is convoluted with the sine wave. Subsequently, a Discrete Fourier Transform, using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is used to determine the frequency components
